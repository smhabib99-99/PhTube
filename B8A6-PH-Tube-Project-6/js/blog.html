                var is a variable in Javascript which has a global scope.
                where let and const is also variables in Javascript whose scope is block scope.
                That means it can't be access outside of block of that variable.
            </p>

                Q2.Ans <br>
                Okay!, null means it has empty value or blank value where undefined means it has no value
                that means variable is declared but value isn't assigned.

                Q3.Ans <br>
                In general API is called REST API or RESTful API. REST=> represents Representational State Transfer.
                I mean REST API is needed when client device request for data using API at that time server gives/transfer the data of current state in json form.
